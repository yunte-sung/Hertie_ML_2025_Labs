    "To run this Jupyter notebook, follow these steps:\n",
    "1. make sure the `ml2025` environment you created in step 2 is activated\n",
    "2. install jupyter into this environment using the `pip install jupyter` command (installing something *into* an environment just means that you need to run the installation command after having activated the environment)\n",
    "3. now move into the directory for the DS&A repository that you cloned in step 3 (called `Hertie_ML_2025_Labs`).\n",
    "4. run `jupyter notebook`; this will start your default browser (or open a new tab) and you should now see a folder structure that includes the Jupyter notebook file `lab1.ipynb`\n",

    "- This is where you'll write classes, functions, helper functions, tests etc. \n",
    "- I recommend VS Code or PyCharm, because it they have many 'intelligent code' features such as code prediction, readability, error detection, easy refactoring, and because it provides debugging tools.\n",
    "- You can either open a project from the IDE, or open the file using the IDE programme. \n",
    "    - The 'more correct' way is to open up the project from the IDE.\n",

    "        - select `Open Folder`\n",
    "        - select the `Interpreter` (top right, also the central top bar), choose the Python installation that is within the `ml2025` conda environment you created above.\n",
    "    - **For PyCharm**\n",
    "        - on the `New Project` screen, set the `Location` path to the path to the `Hertie_ML_2025_Labs` directory \n",
